To automate and manage a sweet shop's daily operations, including inventory control, billing, customer record handling, and sweet item administration, a software application known as the **Sweet Shop administration System** was developed.   By allowing administrators or staff to add, edit, and remove sweet products, track stock levels, generate bills with accurate price calculations, and store customer information, the system minimizes human work and errors.   By using an orderly database and an easy-to-use user interface, the solution boosts productivity, ensures better inventory management, enhances customer service, and provides quick access to sales and stock information.   This project demonstrates the realistic implementation of database management, CRUD tasks, and real-world business automation. Its primary goal is instructional.
